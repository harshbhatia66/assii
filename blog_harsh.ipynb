    "a) From DRY to Design Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "i. \n",
    "After looking at the code we found that:\n",
    "- In the original code for the `Mercenary.java` and `ZombieToast.java` classes, there is a repeated code pattern for random movement. \n",
    "\n",
    "ii.\n",
    "The repeated code for random movement can be improved using the **Template Method Design Pattern**. The essence of this pattern is to define the structure of an algorithm, allowing its steps to be implemented by individual subclasses. In this case:\n",
    "- The `Enemy` class can have a generic `moveRandom()` method (acting as a template method), which contains the common logic for random movement.\n",
    "- Specific enemy classes like `Mercenary`, `ZombieToast`, etc., will then use this method without needing to re-implement the logic, ensuring adherence to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics that relate the scenario to the Template Method Pattern:\n",
    "- We have a common algorithm structure (random movement) that's shared among different classes (`Mercenary`, `ZombieToast`).\n",
    "- Only parts of the algorithm are subjected to change (specific conditions under which random movement happens), while the overall structure remains the same.\n",
    "- By moving the shared logic to a superclass (`Enemy`), we avoid repetition in the subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii.\n",
    "Refactoring using the Template Method Design Pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "In `Enemy.java`:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Added method for random movement\n",
    "public void moveRandom(Game game) {\n",
    "    Position nextPosition;\n",
    "    GameMap gameMap = game.getMap();\n",
    "    List<Position> validPositions = getPosition().getCardinallyAdjacentPositions();\n",
    "    validPositions = validPositions.stream().filter(p -> gameMap.canMoveTo(this, p)).collect(Collectors.toList());\n",
    "    if (validPositions.isEmpty()) {\n",
    "        nextPosition = getPosition();\n",
    "    } else {\n",
    "        nextPosition = validPositions.get(randGen.nextInt(validPositions.size()));\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    gameMap.moveTo(this, nextPosition);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In `Mercenary.java`:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Removed the old random movement code and replaced it with moveRandom(game)\n",
    "private void moveWhenInvisible(Game game) {\n",
    "    moveRandom(game);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In `ZombieToast.java`:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// Removed the old random movement code and replaced it with moveRandom(game)\n",
    "@Override\n",
    "public void move(Game game) {\n",
    "    moveRandom(game);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By this refactoring:\n",
    "- The repeated random movement code has been moved to the `Enemy` superclass.\n",
    "- Subclasses (`Mercenary`, `ZombieToast`) utilize the `moveRandom()` method from `Enemy` whenever they need random movement logic, avoiding code repetition."
